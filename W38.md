# Week 38 assignments - Python Coding Contest

This is W38 assignment for the Python Coding Challenges of [Math & Chess Club in Ottawa](https://online2learn.wordpress.com/).

## Prerequisites
*Only needed if you have not done any assignments after the test run*
1. Update `mcc_api`: the Download the `mcc_api` package, which is this repository, by click on the green `↓ Code` button on this page, or by clicking this: [download it](https://github.com/nghia71/mcc_api/archive/master.zip). Unzip it into a folder. This folder will be where you're going to place your Python scripts.
2. (Optional) Download your personal access from your assigned folder on the club's Google drive. It should be inside the `Astria` directory (folder) with your name as part of the file name. Rename this new file into `mcc.conf` and delete the old file.
3. Test Pegasus if it is ready by running the following in an enabled virtual environement of Python 3.8+:

    python check_pegasus.py

    Open a tab on your favourite browser by clicking on this link to [Astria](http://206.47.13.10:8080).

Then, the program will give you four submission examples for three given problems.

***It is important to know that***:
- your submissions will be graded by `Astria`.
- you have submitted that working code into your assigned folder on the club's drive.

*Note 1: You can team up with one (but not more than one) person to work on and solve these three problems.*

*Note 2: You can ask someone for ideas, code syntax problems, etc. You should not ask other people to write, dictate, or copy code from. Remember, you learn for yourself and in the actual challenges, there is no one to help you, except perhaps your teammates.*

### Problem One: Where's Waldorf?
#### The problem: *Given an `m` by `n` grid of letters and a list of words, find the location in the grid at which the word can be found. A word matches a straight, uninterrupted line of letters in the grid. A word can match the letters in the grid regardless of case (i.e., upper- and lowercase letters are to be treated as the same). The matching can be done in any of the eight horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions through the grid.*

You are given `w38_where_waldorf.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below:

    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the word, dimensions, and the grid via Pegasus
    word_and_m_n_grid = p.attempt('where_waldorf')

    ########################################
    # Figure out where the word is and submit to Astria
    coordinates = where_waldorf(word_and_m_n_grid)
    result = p.submit('where_waldorf', word_and_m_n_grid, coordinates)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('where_waldorf', result)

Note that a new `attempt` member function of Pegasus is implemented in order to request the input for the problem from Astria. In another word Astria creates a random input and returns that via Pegasus to you.

The *word_and_m_n_grid* string contains:
 - a word of English alphabets with no more than `10` characters. The  may contain upper- and lowercase letters only – no spaces, hyphens, or other non-alphabetic characters;
 - the dimensions `m (1 <= m <= 50)`, `n (1 <= n <= 50)` of the grid (separated by a space character);
 - the grid contains `m` lines containing `n` letters each, representing the grid of letters where the words must be found. The letters in the grid may be in upper- or lowercase. The lines are separated by separated by a `line-feed` character (`\n`).
 - all the above elements are separated by a `line-feed` character. When printed on the screen the `\n` characters do not show and the input looks neat.


 For example:

    Waldorf
    8 11
    abcDEFGhigg
    hEbkWalDork
    FtyAwaldORm
    FtsimrLqsrc
    byoArBeDeyv
    Klcbqwikomk
    strEBGadhrb
    yUiqlxcnBjf


Note that the string itself looks like as below (with `\n` represents the line-feed characters, which are not visible)

`Waldorf\n8 11\nabcDEFGhigg\nhEbkWalDork\nFtyAwaldORm\nFtsimrLqsrc\nbyoArBeDeyv\nKlcbqwikomk\nstrEBGadhrb\nyUiqlxcnBjf`

For the word, output a pair of integer coordinates representing its location in the grid. The integers must be separated by a single space. The first integer is the line in the grid where the first letter of the given word can be found (`0` represents the topmost line in the grid, and `m-1` represents the bottommost line). The second integer is the column in the grid where the first letter of the given word can be found (`0` represents the leftmost column in the grid, and `n-1` represents the rightmost column in the grid).

For example as output of the input above

    1 4


##### The task: *Your implementation of where_waldorf has find all apperances of the word in the give grid*

Now, you have to implement the `where_waldorf` function and make sure that when it receive an input as

You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

You have to concentrating on implementing a correct lcd_display function that returns the missing difference.

### Problem Two: Primary Arithmetic
#### The problem: ***Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right to left, one digit at a time. Many find the “carry” operation, where a 1 is carried from one digit position to the next, to be a significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition problems so that educators may assess their difficulty..***

The input is a string containing two positive integers, each has less than or equal `100` digits, separated by a space character.

For example:

    10001 2009


You have to compute the number of carry operations that result from adding the two numbers and return the number of carry operations followed by the sum of the two integers, and separated by a space character.

For example:

    12010 1

You are given `w38_primary_arithmetic.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below

    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the two numbers via Pegasus.
    i_and_j = p.attempt('primary_arithmetic')

    ########################################
    # Figure out the number of carry operations and the sum and submit to Astria
    carry_sum = primary_arithmetic(i_and_j)
    result = p.submit('primary_arithmetic', i_and_j, carry_sum)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('primary_arithmetic', result)


##### The task: *Your implementation of primary_arithmetic has to figure out the number of carry operations and the sum of two given numbers*

Now, you have to implement the `primary_arithmetic` function and make sure that it works for the below. You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

## Recording of results and submissions
`Astria` records all your submissions. Every single one. She also keeps the final submission of each problem, so don't be worried if you lost the right answer in your testing. This also means she can see your guesses and brute force answers, so solve wisely.
