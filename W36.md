# Week 36 assignments - Python Coding Contest

This is W36 assignment for the Python Coding Challenges of [Math & Chess Club in Ottawa](https://online2learn.wordpress.com/).

## Prerequisites
1. Update `mcc_api`: the Download the `mcc_api` package, which is this repository, by click on the green `↓ Code` button on this page, or by clicking this: [download it](https://github.com/nghia71/mcc_api/archive/master.zip). Unzip it into a folder. This folder will be where you're going to place your Python scripts.
2. (Optional) download your personal access from your assigned folder on the club's Google drive. It should be inside the `Astria` directory (folder) with your name as part of the file name. Rename this new file into `mcc.conf` and delete the old file.
3. Test Pegasus if it is ready
First, open a tab on your favourite browser by clicking on this link to [Astria](http://206.47.13.10:8080).

Then, the program will give you four submission examples for three given problems.

***It is important to know that***:
- your submissions will be graded by `Astria`.
- you have submitted that working code into your assigned folder on the club's drive.

*Note 1: You can team up with one (but not more than one) person to work on and solve these three problems.*

*Note 2: You can ask someone for ideas, code syntax problems, etc. You should not ask other people to write, dictate, or copy code from. Remember, you learn for yourself and in the actual challenges, there is no one to help you, except perhaps your teammates.*

### Problem One: Find the missing number of a Jolly Jumper sequence
#### The problem: *A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a Jolly Jumper if the absolute value of the differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n-1*

For instance: 1 4 2 3 is a jolly jumper because the absolute differences are 3, 2, and 1, respectively.

You are given `w36_jolly_jumper.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below

    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the sequence via Pegasus
    sequence = p.attempt('jolly_jumpers')

    ########################################
    # Figure out what is the missing numbers and submit to Astria
    missing_number = missing_difference(sequence)
    result = p.submit('jolly_jumpers', sequence, missing_number)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('jolly_jumpers', result)

Note that a new `attempt` member function of Pegasus is implemented in order to request the input for the problem from Astria. In another word Astria creates a random sequence and returns that via Pegasus to you.

The sequence that you receive from Astria is a string, which contains 100 numbers separated by a space character. So that there are 99 absolute differences of consecutive terms. The differences are numbers between from 1 to 100. For example  you would receive this list `2 3 4 5 ... 99 102 103`.

The Jolly Jumper is not complete because one of the numbers between 1 and 100 is missing. Your task is to write a function to determine that number.

##### The task: *Your implementation of missing_difference has to find the missing difference in the jolly jumper*

Now, you have to implement the `missing_difference` function and make sure that it works for the below. You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

You have to concentrating on implementing a correct missing_difference function that returns the missing difference.

### Problem Two: Minesweeper
#### The problem: ***Have you ever played Minesweeper? This cute little game comes with a certain operating system whose name we can’t remember. The goal of the game is to find where all the mines are located within a M × N field. The game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. Each square has at most eight adjacent squares. The 4 × 4 field on the left contains two mines, each represented by a * character. If we represent the same field by the hint numbers described above, we end up with the field on the right:***

    *...          *100
    ....          2210
    .*..          1*10
    ....          1110

What will Astria deliver to you is a 16-character string, for example, for this field:

    *...
    ....
    .*..
    ....

You will receive:

    *........*......

You are given `w36_mine_sweeper.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below

    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the field via Pegasus.
    field = p.attempt('mine_sweeper')

    ########################################
    # Figure out the values of other squares of the field and submit to Astria
    detected = mine_sweeper(field)
    result = p.submit('mine_sweeper', field, detected)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('mine_sweeper', result)

For the example above, the detected field should be returned to Astria as also a 16-character string as:

    *10022101*101110

##### The task: *Your implementation of mine_sweeper has to figure out the values of other squares in the given field*

Now, you have to implement the `mine_sweeper` function and make sure that it works for the below. You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

You have to concentrating on implementing a correct mine_sweeper function that returns field with the detected squares.

## Recording of results and submissions
`Astria` records all your submissions. Every single one. She also keeps the final submission of each problem, so don't be worried if you lost the right answer in your testing. This also means she can see your guesses and brute force answers, so solve wisely.
