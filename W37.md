# Week 37 assignments - Python Coding Contest

This is W37 assignment for the Python Coding Challenges of [Math & Chess Club in Ottawa](https://online2learn.wordpress.com/).

## Prerequisites
*Only needed if you have not done any assignments after the test run*
1. Update `mcc_api`: the Download the `mcc_api` package, which is this repository, by click on the green `↓ Code` button on this page, or by clicking this: [download it](https://github.com/nghia71/mcc_api/archive/master.zip). Unzip it into a folder. This folder will be where you're going to place your Python scripts.
2. (Optional) Download your personal access from your assigned folder on the club's Google drive. It should be inside the `Astria` directory (folder) with your name as part of the file name. Rename this new file into `mcc.conf` and delete the old file.
3. Test Pegasus if it is ready by running the following in an enabled virtual environement of Python 3.8+:

    python check_pegasus.py

    Open a tab on your favourite browser by clicking on this link to [Astria](http://206.47.13.10:8080).

Then, the program will give you four submission examples for three given problems.

***It is important to know that***:
- your submissions will be graded by `Astria`.
- you have submitted that working code into your assigned folder on the club's drive.

*Note 1: You can team up with one (but not more than one) person to work on and solve these three problems.*

*Note 2: You can ask someone for ideas, code syntax problems, etc. You should not ask other people to write, dictate, or copy code from. Remember, you learn for yourself and in the actual challenges, there is no one to help you, except perhaps your teammates.*

### Problem One: LCD Display
#### The problem: *A friend of yours has just bought a new computer. Before this, the most powerful machine he ever used was a pocket calculator. He is a little disappointed because he liked the LCD display of his calculator more than the screen on his new computer! To make him happy, write a program that prints numbers in LCD display style*

You are given `w37_lcd_display.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below:

    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the size and sequence via Pegasus
    size_and_sequence = p.attempt('lcd_display')

    ########################################
    # Figure out how to draw it and submit to Astria
    layout = lcd_display(size_and_sequence)
    result = p.submit('lcd_display', size_and_sequence, layout)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('lcd_display', result)

Note that a new `attempt` member function of Pegasus is implemented in order to request the input for the problem from Astria. In another word Astria creates a random input and returns that via Pegasus to you.

The *size_and_sequence* string contains a size *`s (1 <= s <= 10)`* and an integer *`n (0 <= n <= 99999999)`* separated by a space character. For example:

`2 12345`

or

`3 67890`

You need to construct a print layout of the sequence specified in the input as if it is on an LCD display-style using *s* number of ``“-”`` signs for the horizontal segments and *s* number of `“|”` signs for the vertical ones. Each digit occupies exactly *s + 2* columns and *2s + 3* rows. Be sure to fill all the white space occupied by the digits with blanks, including the last digit. There must be exactly one column of blanks between two digits.

For example `2 12345` shall has the following layout. Note that the white space ` ` characters inside the *(s + 2)x(2s + 3)* rectangles are substituted by the dot `.` characters, the white space ` ` characters forming the column *1x(2s + 3)*`.` is left as-is for better visibility.

      .... .--. .--. .... .--.
      ...| ...| ...| |..| |...
      ...| ...| ...| |..| |...
      .... .--. .--. .--. .--.
      ...| |... ...| ...| ...|
      ...| |... ...| ...| ...|
      .... .--. .--. .... .--.

For example `3 67890` shall has the following layout.

      .---. .---. .---. .---. .---.
      |.... ....| |...| |...| |...|
      |.... ....| |...| |...| |...|
      |.... ....| |...| |...| |...|
      .---. ..... .---. .---. .....
      |...| ....| |...| ....| |...|
      |...| ....| |...| ....| |...|
      |...| ....| |...| ....| |...|
      .---. ..... .---. .---. .---.

##### The task: *Your implementation of lcd_display has construct an correct layout of an integer (a sequence of digits) based on a given size*

Now, you have to implement the `lcd_display` function and make sure that when it receive an input as

`2 12345`

it shall return the layout

    .... .--. .--. .... .--.
    ...| ...| ...| |..| |...
    ...| ...| ...| |..| |...
    .... .--. .--. .--. .--.
    ...| |... ...| ...| ...|
    ...| |... ...| ...| ...|
    .... .--. .--. .... .--.

as a single string by concatenation as below:

    ......--...--........--....|....|....|.|..|.|......|....|....|.|..|.|.........--...--...--...--....|.|.......|....|....|...|.|.......|....|....|......--...--........--.

***Note that all dot `.` characters shall be considered as white spaces.***

You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

You have to concentrating on implementing a correct lcd_display function that returns the missing difference.

### Problem Two: The 3n + 1 Problem
#### The problem: ***Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1.***

For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for `n = 22`:

    22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

It is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at `n = 1` for every integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least `1000000`.
For an input *n*, the *cycle-length of n* is the number of numbers generated up to and ***including the 1***. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two numbers *i* and *j*, you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers between *i* and *j*, including both endpoints.

For example if you receive from Astria a string containing two integers separated by a space character:

`1 10`

Then you have to compute what is the maximum cycle length over all numbers between `1` and `10`, which is `20`.

Another example: the maximum cycle length over all numbers between `100` and `200` is `125`.

You are given `w37_cycle_length.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below

    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the two numbers via Pegasus.
    i_and_j = p.attempt('cycle_length')

    ########################################
    # Figure out the maximum cycle length and submit to Astria
    max_length = cycle_length(i_and_j)
    result = p.submit('cycle_length', i_and_j, max_length)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('cycle_length', result)


##### The task: *Your implementation of cycle_length has to figure out the maximum cycle length over all numbers between two given numbers*

Now, you have to implement the `cycle_length` function and make sure that it works for the below. You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

You have to concentrating on implementing a correct cycle_length function that returns field with the detected squares.

## Recording of results and submissions
`Astria` records all your submissions. Every single one. She also keeps the final submission of each problem, so don't be worried if you lost the right answer in your testing. This also means she can see your guesses and brute force answers, so solve wisely.
