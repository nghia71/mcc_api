# Week 39 assignments - Python Coding Contest

This is W39 assignment for the Python Coding Challenges of [Math & Chess Club in Ottawa](https://online2learn.wordpress.com/).

## Prerequisites
*Only needed if you have not done any assignments after the test run*
1. Update `mcc_api`: the Download the `mcc_api` package, which is this repository, by click on the green `↓ Code` button on this page, or by clicking this: [download it](https://github.com/nghia71/mcc_api/archive/master.zip). Unzip it into a folder. This folder will be where you're going to place your Python scripts.
2. (Optional) Download your personal access from your assigned folder on the club's Google drive. It should be inside the `Astria` directory (folder) with your name as part of the file name. Rename this new file into `mcc.conf` and delete the old file.
3. Test Pegasus if it is ready by running the following in an enabled virtual environement of Python 3.8+:

    python check_pegasus.py

    Open a tab on your favourite browser by clicking on this link to [Astria](http://206.47.13.10:8080).

Then, the program will give you four submission examples for three given problems.

***It is important to know that***:
- your submissions will be graded by `Astria`.
- you have submitted that working code into your assigned folder on the club's drive.

*Note 1: You can team up with one (but not more than one) person to work on and solve these three problems.*

*Note 2: You can ask someone for ideas, code syntax problems, etc. You should not ask other people to write, dictate, or copy code from. Remember, you learn for yourself and in the actual challenges, there is no one to help you, except perhaps your teammates.*

### Problem One: Poker Hands
#### The problem: *A poker deck contains 52 cards. Each card has a suit of either clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades (denoted C, D, H, S in the input data). Each card also has a value of either 2 through 10, jack, queen, king, or ace (denoted 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A). For scoring purposes card values are ordered as above, with 2 having the lowest and ace the highest value. The suit has no impact on value. A poker hand consists of five cards dealt from the deck.*


Poker hands are ranked by the following partial order from lowest to highest:
- `High Card.` Hands which do not fit any higher category are ranked by the value of their highest card. If the highest cards have the same value, the hands are ranked by the next highest, and so on.
- `Pair`. Two of the five cards in the hand have the same value. Hands which both contain a pair are ranked by the value of the cards forming the pair. If these values are the same, the hands are ranked by the values of the cards not forming the pair, in decreasing order.
- `Two Pairs`. The hand contains two different pairs. Hands which both contain two pairs are ranked by the value of their highest pair. Hands with the same highest pair are ranked by the value of their other pair. If these values are the same the hands are ranked by the value of the remaining card.
- `Three of a Kind`. Three of the cards in the hand have the same value. Hands which both contain three of a kind are ranked by the value of the three cards.
- `Straight`. Hand contains five cards with consecutive values. Hands which both contain a straight are ranked by their highest card.
- `Flush`. Hand contains five cards of the same suit. Hands which are both flushes are ranked using the rules for High Card.
- `Full House`. Three cards of the same value, with the remaining two cards forming a pair. Ranked by the value of the three cards.
- `Four of a Kind`. Four cards with the same value. Ranked by the value of the four cards.
- `Straight Flush`. Five cards of the same suit with consecutive values. Ranked by the highest card in the hand.

Your job is to ***compare a number of poker hands and to indicate the order of them*** according to the previous ranking. To make it easier, any *two hands are not in the same category*, i.e. there is no two `Full House` hands.

You are given `w39_poker_hands.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below:

    # Setup your credentials
    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the hands via Pegasus
    hands = p.attempt('poker_hands')

    ########################################
    # Figure out what is the order of the hands and submit to Astria
    order = poker_hands(hands)
    result = p.submit('poker_hands', hands, order)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('poker_hands', result)


The *hands* input contains several lines, separated by the line-feed character `\n`, each containing the designation of five cards. Each card is indicated by a `value` (2, 3, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A), follow by a `suit` (clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades - denoted C, D, H, S). The cards are separated by a space ` ` character.

The example hand `2H 3D 5S 9C KD` is same as `2♥ 3♦ 5♠ 9♣ K♦`, which is basically  a `High Card` hand with `K♦` is the highest card.


Here's an example input. Note that *all cards are different since they are dealt from a single pack*. Also note that the string itself looks like as below (with `\n` represents the line-feed characters, which are not visible)

    2H 3D 5S 9C KD
    2C 4S 4C 2D 4H
    2S 8S AS QS 3S

In the input above, `High Card` hand is followed by a `Full House`, and a `Flush`.

The correct answer for the output should be

    1 2 0

indicates that the order of the hands is the second hand, followed by the third hand, and then the first hand.

##### The task: *Your implementation of poker_hands has to determine the correct order of the given hands*

Now, you have to implement the `poker_hands` function and make sure that when it ranks the hands in correct order. Pay attention to the position of each hand in the order.

You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

You have to concentrating on implementing a correct lcd_display function that returns the missing difference.

### Problem Two: Carmichael Numbers
#### The problem: ***Certain cryptographic algorithms make use of big prime numbers. However, checking whether a big number is prime is not so easy. Randomized primality tests exist that offer a high degree of confidence of accurate determination at low cost, such as the Fermat Primality Test.***

***Definition***: a *Carmichael Number* is a composite number `n` for which: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a%5En%5Cequiv%20a%5Cpmod%7Bn%7D" title="Carmichael Number"/>,  for all integers `a`.

Obviously it is adequate to verify - the *Fermat Primality Test* - for all `a` between `2` and `n − 1`, where `n` is the number whose primality we are testing. Then, if `n` is not a prime number then it is a *Carmichael Number*, in another word a `pseudoprime (probably a prime)` if the following equation holds: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a%5En%5Cequiv%20a%5Cpmod%7Bn%7D" title="Carmichael Number"/>.

For example 561, 1729 are *Carmichael Numbers*, but 17, 431, 1109 are not.

You have to find if the number is a *Carmichael Number*:
- it passes the *Fermat Primality Test*, and
- it is not a prime

The output for the given input a *Carmichael Number* should be `'1'` and
`'0'` for all other.


You are given `w39_carmichael_numbers.py` script. In this script the problem is solved by execution of the below

    # Setup your credentials
    p = Pegasus('mcc.conf')

    ########################################
    # Receive the number via Pegasus
    number = p.attempt('carmichael_numbers')

    ########################################
    # Figure out what the number and submit to Astria
    is_carmichael_number = carmichael_numbers(number)
    result = p.submit('carmichael_numbers', number, is_carmichael_number)

    ########################################
    # See what's the answer from Astria
    print('carmichael_numbers', result)


##### The task: *Your implementation of carmichael_numbers has to figure out if a given number `n`, where `(2 <= n <= 65000)` is a Carmichael Number.*

Now, you have to implement the `carmichael_numbers` function and make sure that it works for the below. You don't have to change any code in the main body of the script, i.e. the lines after:

    if __name__ == '__main__':

## Recording of results and submissions
`Astria` records all your submissions. Every single one. She also keeps the final submission of each problem, so don't be worried if you lost the right answer in your testing. This also means she can see your guesses and brute force answers, so solve wisely.
